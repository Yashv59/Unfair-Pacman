This project was developed as the final year assignment for my college. It is a recreation of the classic arcade game where the player controls Pacman, a yellow character that navigates a maze, collects pellets, and avoids ghosts.

Controls -:
Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the movement of Pacman:
